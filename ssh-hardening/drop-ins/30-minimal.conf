# Minimal Device SSH Override Configuration
# Purpose: Placeholder for minimal devices (no overrides needed)
# Deployment: /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/30-minimal.conf (optional)
# Device Role: Headless servers, IoT devices, minimal SSH usage
#
# This file contains no active settings - the base config is sufficient.
# Use this as a template if you need minimal overrides for specific edge cases.
#
# Rationale: Minimal devices don't need X11, TCP forwarding, or agent forwarding.
# The base hardened config provides maximum security with no additional features.
